## Weave Frames

In the same way the _Web_ is an open standard and there are _Web Browsers_ that allow you to navigate it,
in _Weave_ you have _Weave Frames_ that allow you to navigate it.

- [Moss](https://github.com/lightningrodlabs/moss) is a reference implementation. [Latest releases](https://github.com/lightningrodlabs/moss/releases).

At the moment Weave and Moss are being co-evolved together as it is discovered what is needed. So don't be surprised if the line between Moss and Weave seems difuse.

## Happs

These Holochain happs are already Weave compatible:

###  [Lightningrod Labs](https://lightningrodlabs.org/)

Lightningrod Labs is a team with the purpose of nurturing the Holochain ecosystem. The organization
is slightly hierarchical with Eric Harris-Brown overseeing, funding and holding the space for the labs.

<abbr title="Lightningrod Labs">LrL</abbr> is to the [Holochain Foundation](https://www.holochain.org/foundation/) what the [Moon](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/The_Bangkok_Supermoon_Photographs_by_Peak_Hora_10.jpg/2560px-The_Bangkok_Supermoon_Photographs_by_Peak_Hora_10.jpg) is to the [Earth](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5b/The_Blue_Marble_%285052124705%29.jpg).

The team is currently taking responsibility for evolving the Weave protocol, developing the Moss reference frame, creating libraries to make the developing process easier, creating a mix of composable useful happs for groups, and connecting with the communities that can benefit from Weave and can get them feedback.

One of the goals is of fully [dogfeeding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food) Moss and using it for all the team activities. This hasn't been archived yet and the team still relies on Discord as a backup.
